# sign-language-detection
Model developed for detecting the american sign language for deaf people using computer vision.

First i had preprocessed the data and trained the model using CNN which creates the feature maps such that we can detect the features which are the signs of sign language.
After creating the model i saved it and used opencv and mediapipe to take the real time input data from the webcam and prerpocess them using pandas and predict the output using the trained model.

The Refrences i got from are -
